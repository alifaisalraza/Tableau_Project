# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Option 1: to find trends of earnings, consumer and real estate prices and their inter relationship with each other.

## Process
### (your step 1)
Data Preparation:
a) Weekly earnings data read from json file and consolidated into csv format for earnings data analysis.

b) Consumer index information consolidated as yearly averages for linear analysis with housing index.

c) Real estate index and prices consolidated as yearly averages on country and district level for index/pricing analysis.

### (your step 2)
Data Analysis:
a) Housing index and pricing plotted and trends observed.

b) Office and housing indices plotted together for comparison.

c) Provincial level heatmap and district level housing indices plotted for pattern observation.

d) Housing prices and annual earnings plotted together for comparison.

e) Consumer and housing indices plotted together for verification of existance of linear relationship.

## Results
a) It is clear from the trends that both housing and office show an upward trend in prices with time. The pattern data in housing sector is stronger. This trend has only shown signs of lull or reversal in case of disruptive events like financial crisis (2007-2009), dot com bubbles (2000-2002) etc. Otherwise, the upward trend is unmistakably strong.

b) The housing sector is most prominant in provinces and districts of Ontario and British Columbia which shapes the overall housing situation in Canada. Other provinces don't show such upwards consistent trends and instead show a mixed or best slow upward trend.

c) The earnings trend in comparison to housing sector is static and shows minimal improvement. Hence, the gap ratio has consistently shown an upward trend which is worrisome for the health and consistency of the real estate sector.

d) There is strong correlation between housing index and consumer index. The level of correlation is very high (93%). This means that housing price indices can strongly predict the consumer pricing pattern within the economy. 

## Challenges 
a) The datasets are not aggregated and hence require consolidation at yearly averages level to begin data analysis.

b) There is no common relationship between different datasets except for their reporting years.

c) The datasets for provinces and districts is aligned more towards economically prominant provinces like Ontario, British Columbia etc. in comparison to other provinces.
